Description: 
    proxyC computes proximity between rows or columns of large matrices efficiently in C++. 
    It is optimized for large sparse matrices using the Armadillo and Intel TBB libraries. 
    Among several built-in similarity/distance measures, computation of correlation, cosine similarity and Euclidean distance is particularly fast.
