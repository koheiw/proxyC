Description: 
    Computes proximity between rows or columns of large matrices efficiently in C++.
    Functions are optimised for large sparse matrices using the Armadillo and Intel TBB libraries.
    Among various built-in similarity/distance measures, computation of correlation,
    cosine similarity and Euclidean distance is particularly fast.
